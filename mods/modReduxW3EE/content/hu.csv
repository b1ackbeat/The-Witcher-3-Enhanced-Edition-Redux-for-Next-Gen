2118472536||item_desc_decoction_10|Poison does not weaken you. Applying poison to enemies reduces your toxicity by 1. Opponents who cause you to bleed are poisoned.

2118472538|363f99b1||If your toxicity meter fills completely, you'll take poison damage from your toxicity gain and enter a fevered state with lowered speed and stamina regeneration. Drink a White Honey to recover.
2118472539|6d1ad461||Heavier armor will absorb more damage and increase your maximum poise, but you pay for that protection in slower speed, lower stamina regeneration, and higher stamina costs.
2118472540|b93269e9||Attacks from behind have 15% higher critical chance and 10% higher damage. Parrying attacks from behind will cost additional poise without the Heightened Senses skill - so watch your rear.
2118472541|6d1ad3a6||Improving your equipment at a grindstone or repair bench will slow its durability loss by 50%.
2118472542|6d1ad424||Use repair kits to keep your equipment in good condition. They repair a portion of missing durability, so the longer you wait to use them the greater their effect.
2118472543|363f99c9||Craftsmen can remove runes and upgrades from your items and return them to you.
2118472544|6d1ad408||Disassembling an item will recover any upgrades within, but they can be removed directly without the need to destroy the item.
2118472545|363f99aa||Enemies with white health bars take little damage from steel swords. Switch to your silver blade, or coat your steel with Argentia oil.
2118472546|6d1ad3ca||Enemies with red health bars can be fought with either sword. Witchers with deep pockets will find silver ideal against monsters, while steel is best against humans and beasts.
2118472547|363f99d0||You can Fast Travel to a harbor while on a boat by pulling up the World Map. Look for boats along the coast and near harbors.
2118472548|6d1ad370||Monster nests can be destroyed with a Dancing Star, Grapeshot or Samum bomb. But consider using the Igni sign instead.
2118472549|6d1ad422||With witcher gear, crafting it is only the first step. Upgrading it will subtly change its stats as well as its appearance.
2118472550|6d1ad369||The weather affects your enemies. You will find it easier to burn foes during the day, but harder during rain or storms.
2118472551|6d1ad3c5||The weather affects your enemies. Necrophages are more dangerous opponents at dusk or during the night. Grave hags are especially comfortable at this hour.
2118472552|6d1ad3a7||The weather affects your enemies. Werewolves are more dangerous at night, and particularly during a full moon. Even regular wolves move more swiftly under a full moon.
2118472553|b93269ed||The weather affects your enemies. You will find Archespores more resilient in the sun.
2118472554|6d1ad445||The weather affects your enemies. Drowners and Sirens love rain and storms, but Harpies find it difficult to maneuver.
2118472555|6d1ad428||The weather affects your enemies. Whenever possible, fight noonwraiths under the moon and nightwraiths under the sun.
2118472556|6d1ad440||The weather affects your enemies. Wielders of magic - such as Sorceresses or Succubi - gain additional power under the moon, especially when full.
2118472557|6d1ad409||Destroyed monster nests are a good source of mutagens, unique monster parts, and even expensive jewelry.
2118472558|6d1ad463||If you're looking to make monster decoctions, merchants who specialize in books may have the uncommon knowledge you seek.
2118472559|6d1ad3a5||When you find a relic blade, it may be in unusable condition. You will need the services of a master weaponsmith to restore it.
2118472560|6d1ad423||Potions, bombs, and oils have high-quality forms that you can make by using high-quality ingredients. Potions can have secondary effects as well.
2118472561|6d1ad389||Every alchemy item requires a base ingredient. Alcohol for potions, animal fat for oils, and saltpetre for bombs are good starting points.
2118472562|6d1ad3ab||Every Sign has an alternate mode, accessible by holding the cast button.
2118472563|b93269ef||You can perform alchemy by meditating at a fire or when visiting an alchemist or herbalist.
2118472564|6d1ad449||If you have sustained a lingering injury, you can treat it immediately with a bandage. They will also heal on their own when meditating at full health.
2118472565|363f99af||You can use Quen to protect yourself from the life-draining aura of a noonwraith or nightwraith. Argentia oil will also temporarily disable it.
2118472566|6d1ad386||When attempting to brew a superior alchemical item, every ingredient must be of pure quality. With the Alchemical Refinement perk, one ingredient can be of lower quality.
2118472567|6d1ad447||Witchers' reflexes are so sharp that a sword is enough defense to swat arrows out of the air as they fly. With proper timing, they can even reflected back to their point of origin.
2118472568|b93269f0||Most opponents have limited stamina, and without it they deal less damage. You can deplete stamina with Aard or Paralysis oil, and attacking them will delay their stamina regeneration.
2118472569|6d1ad387||The Axii Sign is useful outside of combat. It can keep neutral animals from fleeing, calm horses, and even be used during dialogue.
2118472570|6d1ad3a8||While underwater, you cannot draw your swords or cast most Signs. Rely on Aard or your crossbow to deal with underwater attackers.
2118472571|363f99d1||Be careful with your vigor. Each point increases your damage by 10%, and Signs cast with less than full vigor are weaker. Still, the right Sign at the right time can be worth the cost.
2118472572|a4b1c1ec||You can store weapons and armor in a number of stashes throughout the world. Gear stored in one location will be available in all other locations as well.
2118472573|a05ae697||Look for a Runewright east of Novigraad to enchant your gear, but consider saving up first - in runes, glyphs, and especially coin.
2118472574|6d1ad3e3||When it comes to repairing armor, you need the right tools. Light, medium, and heavy armor all have their own specific repair kits.
2118472575|6d1ad3ad||Freeze your opponents solid. By combining two different sources of the chilled effect - for instance, Northern Wind bombs and Aard with the Frostbite skill - the enemy will be frozen in place and take additional damage.
2118472576|6d1ad3cd||If you find yourself doing very little damage to a foe, you may need more armor penetration. Use strong or counterattacks, Corrosive oil, bombs with the Riving Blast skill, or craft a new specialized weapon for these opponents.
2118472577|363f99ce||Critical hits are not only a source of extra damage. They also increase armor penetration and the effects of any oils by 50%.
2118472578|6d1ad3c9||If you hear Geralt telling you to look around some, it means an artifact sword is somewhere nearby. You can disable these comments in Options > Mods > W3EE > Exploration.
2118472579|363f99ae||Poisoned enemies move slower and do less damage. Bleeding enemies are slower to recover stamina and take additional bleed damage while low on stamina.
2118472580|6d1ad425||If you find yourself dying from toxicity without a White Honey at hand, meditating can save your life.
2118472581|363f9a0b||Attacking an enemy under the influence of Axii will make it more difficult to use Axii on them again.
2118472582|6d1ad36d||Looking for the best place to offload your trophies? General merchants and innkeeps are a good place to start. They pay a higher price in Skellige, but merchants in Novigraad have deeper pockets. Toussaint has the best of both.
2118472583|363f99b0||White Honey will immediately cure toxicity fever and reduce toxicity, but will also cancel the effects of other potions. Try to always have one at the ready.
2118472584|363f9a0c||You can customize the attributes of some gear before crafting. Putting your preferred attributes on a sword can tide you over until you can afford expensive artifact blades.
2118472585|6d1ad421||Struggling with ranged opponents? Try casting alternate Yrden before engaging. It offers a reliable zone of protection while you deal with any melee attackers.
2118472586|363f99eb||Try creating your own alchemy bases from ingredients you already have. The savings might start small, but they add up over time.
2118472587|363f99c8||When brewing an enhanced quality alchemical item, a pure ingredient can offset the inclusion of a contaminated one.
2118472588|6d1ad446||Do your saddlebags resemble an alchemical warehouse? Brewing beyond your immediate need can raise your skills. Distilling heavy ingredients or those without secondary effects into primary essences can save weight.
2118472589|6d1ad38b||Struggling with an unfamiliar enemy? The Blizzard potion can help you come to grips with its behavior and pattern of attack.
2118472590|363f9a0d||You can perform a perfect parry by countering without holding any distance modifiers. It lowers your poise costs while staggering the attacker and reducing their poise, and can be used at lower poise levels than counterattacks as well.
2118472591|6d1ad442||When it comes to elemental damage, fire and frost have strong and weak matchups. Ethereal and shock damage are more versatile.
2118472592|6d1ad441||In order to maintain your adrenaline you need to generate some every 4 seconds, otherwise it begins to drain. Try to keep an even tempo in combat.
